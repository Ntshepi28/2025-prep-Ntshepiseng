# Week 0 – GitLab Course Reflection about my progress, challenges, and experience.
  

1.Overview

This week i was learning GitLab Essential Course. I focused on getting familiar with Git basics, GitLab workflows, 
and understanding how version control systems help manage and track changes in a project.

It was a very theorical week, and although I faced a few challenges along the way, 
I really enjoyed exploring the different parts of GitLab, especially the CI/CD pipeline session.

2.What I Covered this week

Here are some of the key things I learned and practiced during the course this week:

. Setting up Git with `git config`
. Creating a local Git repository and connecting it to GitHub/GitLab
. Using commands like:
  .`git init`
  .`git clone`
  . `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`
.Learning about branches, merges, and resolving merge conflicts
.Introduction to GitLab CI/CD pipelines and creating `.gitlab-ci.yml` files
.Uploading and managing folders for each week’s work

3.These are teh git concept i found useful and understand them 

.Staging and Committing: I learned how to make safe, step-by-step changes using the staging area (`git add`) and confirming them with `git commit`.  
.Branching: It’s helpful to use branches when testing new features or working on different tasks so the main project doesn’t break.  

4.This is CI/CD Pipeline part the one i enjoyed the most

The CI/CD session really stood out for me. I enjoyed creating a pipeline file and seeing it automatically run after pushing to GitLab. 
It felt like a real step into DevOps and I liked how it connected code to automation.
Also writing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file was tricky at first, but once I got the hang of it, it made sense and was quite exciting to see it work.

5.The challenges i Faced

. I kept getting confused between `git pull` and `git fetch`. I sometimes used one when I meant the other and sometimes get mixed up between the git commands.
. I didn’t know that Git doesn’t track empty folders, so I had to figure out how to include placeholder files like `.gitkeep`.
. Mistyped some commands and ended up undoing changes or pushing incorrectly. I sometimes commit before adding, then wonder why nothing changed.

Going forward i am looking to improving with practice and starting to develop a workflow that works for me.


Thanks for reading!
