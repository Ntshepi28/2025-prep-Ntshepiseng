# Week 2 – Python Loops and Data Structures  reflection

# Overview

This week we learned about **loops** in Python. I practiced writing different types of loops, including **while loops** and **for loops**.

I also worked with **lists** and **dictionaries**, and used loops to access and print the information stored inside them.

# Summary of My Work

I practiced using while loops to control the flow of the program by counting numbers up and down. This helped me understand how loops keep running while a condition is true and stop when it becomes false.

I learned how to use for loops to repeat actions a certain number of times, which made my code shorter and easier to read compared to writing the same lines multiple times.

I explored how to use the range() function to generate sequences of numbers automatically, which is very helpful for controlling loops without manually listing all the numbers.

I worked with lists and dictionaries to store and organize data, and then used loops to access and print the information stored in them. This showed me how loops and data structures work well together.

I also practiced using the print() function’s end parameter to print multiple characters on the same line instead of each on a new line, which is important for formatting output correctly.

Overall, I saw how loops are powerful tools in programming that help automate repetitive tasks and how combining loops with functions and data structures allows me to write organized and efficient code.

## What I Learned

Loops make it easier to repeat actions in my code without writing the same lines again and again.

I practiced using loops to go through lists and dictionaries, which helped me work with different types of data.

Breaking my code into functions helped me organize my work and made it easier to understand and fix.

Nested loops let me create patterns and work with multiple levels of information, like printing squares of characters.

I learned how to ask users for input repeatedly until they give a valid answer, making my programs more reliable.

This week showed me how combining loops, functions, and data structures helps me write better programs.

## Challenges I Faced

. Understanding when and how to stop loops properly.
. Figuring out how nested loops work and how to print things on the same line.
. Remembering how the `range()` function works, especially that it does not include the last number.
. Accessing dictionary values inside loops.


# What I Enjoyed

. Seeing the patterns print exactly as I wanted.
. Learning how loops make coding easier and cleaner.
. Organizing my code with functions.
. Using lists and dictionaries to store and print information.


# What I will do Next

- Practice loops with more complex data structures.
- Learn error handling with user inputs.
- Try printing other shapes and patterns.
- Use loops with files and other Python modules.
