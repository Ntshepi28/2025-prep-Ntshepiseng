for x in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    print(x)

# we are using a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers from 0 to 4 but this way it want us
# to do things manually and we have to write out the numbers in the list

for x in range(3):
    print("Good morning")    

# we are using a function called range to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 2 and it prints "Good morning" three times
# it is a more efficient way to repeat an action multiple times without manually writing out each number
