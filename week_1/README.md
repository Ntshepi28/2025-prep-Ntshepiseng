# Week 1 - Python Basics: Input, Output, Conditionals, Numbers, and Functions

## Overview

This week was all about getting hands-on with Python. I explored core programming concepts and built small but meaningful programs that helped me understand 
how Python works. I was already familiar with some of the content thanks to the bootcamp, but it still felt new and exciting to put it all into practice on my own.

One surprising thing I discovered was that **Python uses `match-case` instead of the traditional `switch` statement**. That caught me off guard at first, 
but I enjoyed how clean and readable the syntax was. Overall, I really enjoyed everything about this week’s learning journey.

## What I Learned

This week I learned about:
. Variables and how to store user input
. Functions and how to organize code properly
. Conditions using if-else and match-case
. How to work with numbers using `int()` and `float()`

## Challenges
Everything was explained clearly and was easy to follow. I had no challenges this week. The tutorial made things readable and everything made sense as I practiced.


## Reflections

This week gave me a solid foundation in Python. I was able to apply everything from basic input/output to using custom functions. 
The discovery of Python's `match-case` instead of the traditional `switch` was surprising, but it made the code more readable. 
I enjoyed every part of the journey and appreciated that I had some familiarity with a few topics thanks to the bootcamp. 
I’m excited to build on this in Week 2.
